# RprojectDemo

This demonstration shows how to organize a research project using R and Rmarkdown in such a way that:

* Analyses are reproducible
* Reports, talks, and papers all use the same R code
* Papers are compiled to HTML and PDF/Word at the same time; your paper is a website!
* Websites can include interactive figures, while PDF/Word contains static ones
