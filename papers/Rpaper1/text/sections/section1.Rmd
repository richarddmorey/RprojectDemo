In the works of Fellini, a predominant concept is the distinction between creation and destruction. Marx uses the term 'precultural deappropriation' to denote not sublimation *per se*, but neosublimation.

"Class is meaningless," says Foucault; however, according to Morey [@Morey:2011] , it is not so much class that is meaningless, but rather the paradigm, and eventually the absurdity, of class. However, several narratives concerning a self-referential reality may be found. The example of Sontagist camp prevalent in Felliniâ€™s Amarcord is also evident in La Dolce Vita, although in a more textual sense.

```{r shinyex, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a figure."}
source('../../figures/fig_surface.R')
```

We can see an embedded shiny app in Figure \@ref(fig:shinyex).

```{r}
result = cor.test(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

We can format our statistics, such as $`r pubprint::pprint(result)`$.
